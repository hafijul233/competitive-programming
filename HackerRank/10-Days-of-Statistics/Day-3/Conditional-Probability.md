# Question 

In a single toss of ***2*** fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most ***9***.

## Options

1. 2 / 3
2. 5 / 6
3. 1 / 4
4. 1 / 6

## Answer

`5 / 6`

## Explanation

There are total `6 * 6 = 36` outcomes.

Out of `36` posibities, following outcomes are having sum greater than 9. So we don't count them:

`{4, 6}, {5, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 4}, {6, 5}, {6, 6}`.

So we are left with `36 - 6 = 30`. (outcomes having sum AT MOST 9)

The answer is: `30/36 = 5/6`.
