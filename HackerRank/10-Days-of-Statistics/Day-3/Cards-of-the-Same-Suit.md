# Question

You draw ***2*** cards from a standard ***52***-card deck without replacing them. 
What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

## Options

1. 1 / 156
2. 1 / 39
3. 12 / 39
4. 12 /51

## Answer

`12 /51`

## Explanation

In a deck there are ***52*** cards. consist of ***4*** suits of ***13*** card.
According to question when you pick up a card from anywhere of deck
total remaining cards are (***52***-***1***) = ***51*** and possibility of 
the next card on the same suit will be remaining (***13***-***1***) = ***12***. 1 is the card you already picked.
So probability will be {number_of_remaining_cards_with same_suit_left}/{total_cards_left}. 
For Example If you pick Hearts, then it's **13-1**/**52-1** = ***12/51***
